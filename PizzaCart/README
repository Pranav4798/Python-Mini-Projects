*The Pizza Cart Proposal*

You‚Äôve just received a proposal from the owner of a popular local pizza cart. Business is booming, but the current pen-and-paper order system is slowing things down. The owner wants to upgrade and has approached you to develop a simple, user-friendly Python-based ordering application.

Project Requirements:
Build a command-line pizza ordering app that can:

Display a pizza menu with item names and corresponding prices.

Allow the customer to select items by entering the item number or name.

Calculate the total cost, including a fixed tax percentage (e.g., 8.5%).

Show a clear receipt summary at the end.

Bonus Features (if you want to go extra cheesy üçï):
Allow customers to order multiple items.

Give a discount if the total exceeds a certain amount (e.g., 10% off over $50).

Support customization like "extra cheese" or "gluten-free" crusts with added cost.

Store orders in a simple text file (simulating order logs for the vendor).

Display a fun message like ‚ÄúThanks for ordering from The Pizza Cart!‚Äù
